CMPUT414 Project "Dancing Queen"
==============================

This research project analyzes ways to read a music file, and create a dance animation based on the piece. To execute this, algorithms based on beat detection, or frequency and amplitude will be applied. Based on how fast and loud the music is playing, an algorithm will determine what dance animation is mapped and create a flow between the movements. To implement this algorithm, a database will be created of dance moves that will have moves that correspond to the beats per minute, frequency, amplitude or composition. Depending on how fast the song is playing, will determine what type of animation is extracted from the database.
